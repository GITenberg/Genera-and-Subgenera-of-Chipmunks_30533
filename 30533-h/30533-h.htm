<h3><span class="smcap">Introduction</span></h3>


<p>The supraspecific categories of the chipmunks, as in most other
groups of squirrels, have been a source of controversy for many
years. Before presenting new evidence and a review of older evidence
bearing on the problem, it seems desirable to review briefly
in chronological order, the taxonomic history of the genera and subgenera
of the chipmunks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Historical</span></h3>

<p>Linnaeus (1758:64) described the eastern North American chipmunks
under the name <em>Sciurus striatus</em> and based his description
on that of Catesby (1743:75). The Asiatic chipmunk was first described,
under the name <em>Sciurus sibiricus</em>, by Laxmann (1769:69).
Schreber (1785, 4:790) separated the Asiatic and North American
chipmunks into the Asiatic and American varieties. Gmelin
(1788:50) followed Schreber and, employing trinomials, used the
names <em>Sciurus striatus asiaticus</em> and <em>S. s. americanus</em>. Illiger
(1811:83) proposed <em>Tamias</em> as the generic name of the chipmunk
of eastern North America. Say (1823:45) described <em>Sciurus quadrivittatus</em>,
the first species of chipmunk known from western North
America.</p>

<p>Trouessart (1880:86-87) proposed <em>Eutamias</em> as the subgeneric
name to include the western North American and Asiatic chipmunks.</p>

<p>Merriam (1897:189-190) raised <em>Eutamias</em> to full generic rank.
In so doing he neither listed nor described any characters but wrote
that &ldquo;it will be observed that the name <em>Eutamias</em>, proposed by
Trouessart in 1880 as a subgenus of <em>Tamias</em> is here adopted as a
full genus. This is because of the conviction that the superficial
resemblance between the two groups is accidental parallelism, in
no way indicative of affinity. In fact the two groups, if my notion
of their relationship is correct, had different ancestors, <em>Tamias</em>
being an offshoot of the ground-squirrels of the subgenus <em>Ictidomys</em>
of Allen, and <em>Eutamias</em> of the subgenus <em>Ammospermophilus</em>,
Merriam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Howell (1929:23) proposed <em>Neotamias</em> as the subgeneric name
for the chipmunks of western North America, of the genus <em>Eutamias</em>.</p>

<p>Ellerman (1940, 1:426) gave <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Neotamias</em> equal
subgeneric rank with <em>Tamias</em> under the genus <em>Tamias</em>; on pages
427-428 he quoted Merriam, as I have done above, and later, after
quoting the key to the genera and subgenera of chipmunks of
Howell (1929:11), Ellerman wrote (<em>op. cit.</em>: 428-429), &ldquo;This key
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>convinces me that all these forms must be referred to one genus
only. The characters given to separate &lsquo;<em>Eutamias</em>&rsquo; from <em>Tamias</em> are
based only on the absence or presence of the functionless premolar,
and on the colour pattern. If colour pattern is to be used as a
generic character, it seems <em>Citellus suslicus</em> will require a new name
when compared with <em>C. citellus</em>, etc.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;The Asiatic
chipmunk is intermediate between typical <em>Tamias</em> and the small
American forms in many characters.&rdquo; To substantiate this, Ellerman
(<em>loc. cit.</em>) quotes Howell (<em>loc. cit.</em>), in comparing the subgenera
<em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Neotamias</em>, as follows: &ldquo;&lsquo;the ears [of subgenus
<em>Eutamias</em>] are broad, rounded, of medium height, much as in
<em>Tamias</em>; postorbital broad at base, tapering to a point, much as in
<em>Tamias</em>; interorbital constriction slight, as in <em>Tamias</em>; upper molariform
tooth rows slightly convergent posteriorly, as in <em>Tamias</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Ellerman (<em>loc. cit.</em>) again quotes Howell (<em>loc. cit.</em>),
&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Eutamias</em> of
Asia resembles <em>Tamias</em> of North America and differs from American
<em>Eutamias</em> in a number of characters, notably the shape of the
anteorbital
foramen, the postorbital process, the breadth of the interorbital
region, the development of the lambdoidal crest, and the
shape of the external ears. On the other hand, American <em>Eutamias</em>
agrees with the Asiatic members of the genus in the shape of the
rostrum, the well-defined striations of the upper incisors, the presence
of the extra peg-like premolar, and in the pattern of the dorsal
stripes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bryant (1945:372) wrote, &ldquo;I am convinced that Ellerman&#8217;s interpretation
of the relationships of the chipmunks is correct.&rdquo; After
commenting that the presence or absence of P3, &ldquo;is of significance
only in distinguishing between species of squirrels,&rdquo; Bryant adds
that &ldquo;The other differences between the eastern and the western
chipmunks do not appear to be of sufficient phylogenetic importance
to warrant the retention of the two groups as genera.&rdquo;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Methods, Materials, and Acknowledgments</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Characters previously mentioned in the literature as having taxonomic worth
for supraspecific categories of chipmunks were checked by me on specimens
old enough to have worn permanent premolars. Some structural features not
previously used were found to have taxonomic significance. The baculum in
each of the supraspecific categories of sciurids of North America was examined;
the bacula were processed by the method described by White (1951:125) to
obviate &ldquo;variation&rdquo; caused by shriveling of the smaller bacula or breaking of
the more delicate parts of the larger bacula. Mallei and hyoid bones of the
genera and subgenera of the chipmunks were mostly studied in the dry state.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>Part of the hyoid musculature in these same groups of chipmunks was dissected.</p>

<p>In all, I studied more than 1,000 skulls and skins of the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em>,
approximately 50 skulls and skins of <em>Tamias striatus</em>, and 15 skulls and skins
of the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> (<em>Eutamias sibiricus asiaticus</em> from Manchuria).
Numerous other specimens were examined but not in such detail.</p>

<p>I am grateful to Professor E. Raymond Hall for guidance in the study. For
encouragement and advice I am grateful also to Doctors Robert W. Wilson,
Cecil G. Lalicker, Edwin C. Galbreath, Keith R. Kelson, E. Lendell Cockrum,
Olin L. Webb, and others at the Museum of Natural History, and in the
Department of Zoology of the University of Kansas. My wife, Alice M. White,
made the drawings and helped me in many other ways. For lending specimens
I thank Dr. David H. Johnson of the United States National Museum, and Dr.
George C. Rinker of the Department of Anatomy, University of Michigan.</p>

<p>Assistance with field work is acknowledged from the Kansas University
Endowment Association, the National Science Foundation, and the United
States Navy, Office of Naval Research, through contract No. NR161 791.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Evaluation of Characters</span></h3>

<p>The following paragraphs treat the characters listed by Howell,
Ellerman, and Bryant, and such additional characters as I have
found useful in characterizing the genera and subgenera of chipmunks.
Some of the findings, I think, illustrate how study of such
mammalian structures as the baculum, malleus, and hyoid apparatus&mdash;structures
that seem to be little influenced by the changing external
environment&mdash;clarifies relationships, if these previously were
estimated only from other parts of the anatomy of Recent specimens.</p>

<p>The structural features and characters to be discussed, or listed,
below may be arranged in three categories as follows: 1) Characters
in which the subgenera <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Neotamias</em> agree but
are different from the genus <em>Tamias</em>; 2) Characters in which the
subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and the genus <em>Tamias</em> agree but are different
from the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em>; 3) Structural features that are too
weakly expressed to be of taxonomic use.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characters in which the Subgenera Eutamias and Neotamias
Agree, but Differ from the Genus Tamias</span></h3>

<p><em>Structure of the Malleus.</em>&mdash;The malleus in chipmunks is composed
of a head and neck, a manubrium which has a spatulate process at
the end opposite the head, and a muscular process situated about
halfway between the spatulate process and the head of the malleus.
An articular facet begins on the manubrium near the neck and
spirals halfway around the head of the malleus. A lamina extends
from the anterior edge of the head and neck, tapers to a point and
joins the tympanic bulla anteriorly where there is a suture between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
the lamina and bulla. The lamina is one half as long as the rest of
the malleus (see figs. <a href="#fig1_3">1-3</a>).</p>

<p>The head of the malleus in <em>Tamias</em> is clearly more elongated than
in <em>Eutamias</em>. The plane formed by the lamina in <em>Eutamias</em> makes
an angle of approximately 90 degrees with the plane formed by the
manubrium; in <em>Tamias</em> the two planes make an angle of approximately
60 degrees.</p>

<p>Examination of series of mallei of <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Tamias</em> indicate
that there is slight individual variation, slight variation with age,
and no secondary sexual variation. Intraspecific variation in the
subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> is slight, consisting of differences in size.
Specimens of the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> from Manchuria have mallei
which are morphologically close to the mallei of the subgenus
<em>Neotamias</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Structure of the Baculum.</em>&mdash;In discussing the baculum in <em>Eutamias</em>
and <em>Tamias</em>, it seems desirable to do so in the light of the structure
of the baculum in other sciurids.</p>

<p>The bacula of North American sciurids are divisible into six distinct
types represented by those of the genera <em>Spermophilus</em>, <em>Marmota</em>,
<em>Sciurus</em>, <em>Tamiasciurus</em>, <em>Eutamias</em>, and <em>Glaucomys</em>.</p>

<p>The type of baculum in <em>Spermophilus</em> is spoonshaped with a
ventral process that is spinelike or keellike. Also, spines usually are
present along the margin of the &ldquo;spoon.&rdquo; The base (proximal end)
of the baculum is broad, and some species have a winglike process
extending dorsally and partly covering a longitudinal groove. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
shaft is more or less curved downward in the middle
(see figs. <a href="#fig4_10">7, 10</a>).</p>

<p>In <em>Marmota</em> the baculum is greatly enlarged at the posterior end
and forms a shieldlike surface. The ventral surface of the base is
flattened and the ventral surface of the shaft curves slightly ventrally
then dorsally to the tip. The dorsal region of the base culminates
in a point, from which there is a ridge that extends anteriorly and
that tapers rapidly into the shaft near the tip. The tip, dorsally,
has a slight depression surrounded by knobs, which are more or
less well defined, and which resemble, topographically, the spines
described for <em>Spermophilus</em> (see fig. <a href="#fig4_10">8</a>).</p>

<p>In <em>Sciurus</em> the baculum is semispoonshaped and asymmetrical.
There is a winglike process on one side and a spine, which projects
lateroventrally, on the other side of the tip. The base of the
baculum is broad but not so broad as in most species of <em>Spermophilus</em>.
Extending posteriorly from the region of the tip, at which
point a spine projects lateroventrally, there is a ridge, which is often
partly ossified and that extends to a point near the base (see fig. <a href="#fig4_10">4</a>).</p>

<p>In <em>Tamiasciurus</em> the baculum is absent or vestigial (Layne,
1952:457-459).</p>

<p>In <em>Eutamias</em> the baculum is broad at the base and the shaft tapers
distally to the junction of the shaft and tip, or the base is only
slightly wider than any part of the shaft. The tip often forms an
abrupt angle with the shaft and there is a keel on the dorsal surface
of the tip (see figs. <a href="#fig4_10">5, 6</a>).</p>

<p>The baculum in <em>Glaucomys</em> is the most distinctive of that of any
American sciurid. According to Pocock (1923:243-244), &ldquo;The
baculum [of <em>G. volans</em>] is exceedingly long and slender, slightly
sinuous in its proximal third, and inclined slightly upwards distally.
The extreme apex is bifid, the lower process being rounded, the
upper more pointed. On the left side there is a long crest running
from the summit of the upper terminal process and ending abruptly
behind the left side about one-third of the distance from the proximal
end of the bone. It lies over a well-marked groove, and there
is a second shallower groove on the right side of the bone.&rdquo; The
baculum of <em>G. sabrinus</em> is markedly wider, more flattened and
shorter than in <em>G. volans</em>. The crest, which is also present in
<em>G. volans</em>, starts from the upper terminal process and extends to
the base of the baculum on the left side. There is a knoblike process on
the crest at a point three fourths the length of the baculum from its
base. The distal one third of the baculum curves sharply but
smoothly upwards (see fig. <a href="#fig4_10">9</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
Keeping in mind that the baculum in the North American sciurids
can be classified into six structural groups, as given above, the
baculum in each of the subgenera <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Neotamias</em> and in
the genus <em>Tamias</em> is briefly described.</p>

<p>In the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> the baculum resembles a leg and foot
of man, with a narrow ridge (keel) in the center of the &ldquo;instep&rdquo; of
the foot (Howell 1929:27). The tip (=foot) curves dorsally at
the distal end (see figs. <a href="#fig4_10">5, 6</a>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em>, the baculum &ldquo;tapers gradually from
base to tip, the distal portion upturned in an even curve and slightly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
flattened ...&rdquo; (<em>op. cit.</em>:26). Microscopic examination reveals
that there is a faint keel on the dorsal surface of the tip.</p>

<p><em>Eutamias</em>, like <em>Callosciurus</em>, <em>Menetes</em>,
<em>Dremomys</em>, <em>Lariscus</em>, <em>Rhinosciurus</em>,
and <em>Nannosciurus</em>, has a keel on the dorsal surface of the
tip of the baculum (compare figures 5 and 6 with the descriptions
and figures in Pocock, 1923:217-225).</p>

<p>In <em>Tamias</em> the baculum is &ldquo;a slender bone 4.5-5 millimeters in
length, nearly straight, upturned at the tip and slightly expanded
into the shape of a narrow spoon or scoop, with a slight median
ridge on the under surface.&rdquo; (Howell <em>op. cit.</em>:13.) The &ldquo;median
ridge&rdquo; is a keel on the ventral surface. In having a keel on the
ventral surface of the tip, the baculum of <em>Tamias</em> is comparable to
that of <em>Spermophilus</em>.</p>

<p>Examination of series of bacula of the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> and
the genus <em>Tamias</em> indicates, as in the case of the mallei, that there
is slight individual variation and slight variation with age. In the
subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> interspecific variation in the baculum is
considerable, but the general plan of structure remains constant. From
this study of variation of the baculum in American chipmunks, it
can be extrapolated that the baculum in the Asiatic <em>Eutamias</em> would
show little individual variation in structure. I have seen only two
bacula of the Asiatic <em>Eutamias</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Structure of the Hyoid Apparatus.</em>&mdash;The hyoid apparatus in the
chipmunks is made up of an arched basihyal with a thyrohyal attached
to each limb of this &ldquo;arch.&rdquo; To each junction between the
&ldquo;arch&rdquo; and the thyrohyals, a hypohyal is attached by ligaments to a
flat articular surface. A ceratohyal then is attached posteriorly to
the hypohyal and a stylohyal ligament is attached to each ceratohyal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
posteriorly. The stylohyal is loosely attached along its sides to the
tympanic bulla and finally attached, at the posterior end, to the
bulla at a point slightly ventral and posterior to the auditory meatus.</p>

<p>In the genus <em>Eutamias</em> the hypohyal and ceratohyal are completely
fused in adults, the suture between these two bones being visible
in juvenal specimens (see fig. <a href="#fig11_12">12</a>).</p>

<p>In the genus <em>Tamias</em> the hypohyal and ceratohyal remain distinct
throughout life. The hypohyal may frequently be divided into two
parts, a variation which is also present in <em>Marmota</em>.</p>

<p>The musculature associated with the hyoid apparatus in <em>Eutamias</em>
and <em>Tamias</em> is as described by Bryant (1945:310, 316) for the Nearctic
squirrels. However, the conjoining tendon of the anterior and
posterior pairs of digastric muscles is ribbonlike in <em>Eutamias</em> and
rodlike (rounded in cross section) in <em>Tamias</em>.</p>

<p><em>The presence or absence of P3 and the projection of the anterior
root of P4 in relation to the masseteric knob.</em>&mdash;Only rarely is P3
absent in <em>Eutamias</em> or present in <em>Tamias</em>. P3 in specimens of old
adult <em>Eutamias</em>, shows wear, thus suggesting that P3 is functional
in older chipmunks. In <em>Eutamias</em>, which normally has a P3, the
anterior root of P4 projects to the outside of the masseteric knob,
whereas in <em>Tamias</em>, which normally lacks a P3, the anterior root of
P4 projects directly to the masseteric knob or to the lingual side of
this structure. The projection of the anterior root of P4 seems to
be correlated with the presence or absence of P3. However, in a
specimen of <em>Tamias striatus rufescens</em> (No. 11117 KU), the left P3
is present, yet the anterior root of P4 still projects to the lingual
side of the masseteric knob.</p>

<p>Ellerman (1940:48) and Bryant (1945:368-369, 372) think that
the presence or absence of P3 is not of generic significance in chipmunks,
since P3 is vestigial and probably is in the process of being
lost, and since this character is rarely used as a generic character
in other sciurids. I think that the presence or absence of P3, together
with the projection of the anterior root of P4 in relation to
the masseteric knob, is of generic significance, for, squirrels in general
have retained the dentition and dental formula of a primitive
rodent, and any change in the pattern of the teeth or in dental
formula is, in my opinion, of a fundamental nature.</p>

<p><em>Length of tail in relation to total length.</em>&mdash;The tail in <em>Eutamias</em>
is more than 40 per cent of the total length, whereas in <em>Tamias</em> the
tail is less than 38 per cent of the total length. In this respect
<em>Tamias</em> resembles most ground squirrels of the genus <em>Spermophilus</em>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
<em>Color pattern.</em>&mdash;The chipmunks vary but little in color pattern,
for, even in <em>Eutamias dorsalis</em>, which is one of the most aberrant
of the chipmunks in color pattern, the pattern is characteristic of
<em>Eutamias</em>.</p>

<p>The width of the longitudinal stripes is uniform in <em>Eutamias</em>
whereas in <em>Tamias</em> the dorsal, longitudinal light stripes are more
than twice as wide as the other stripes.</p>

<p>In <em>Eutamias</em>, only the two lateralmost dark stripes are short,
whereas in <em>Tamias</em> all four of the lateral dark stripes are short; none
extends to the rump or to the shoulder.</p>

<p>The dark median stripe is present in both <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Tamias</em>
as well as in other genera such as <em>Callosciurus</em> and <em>Menetes</em> (Ellerman
1940:390).</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Characters in which the Subgenus Eutamias and the Genus
Tamias Agree,<br />
but Differ from the Subgenus Neotamias</span></h3>

<p><em>Shape of the infraorbital foramen.</em>&mdash;In the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em>
and in the genus <em>Tamias</em> the infraorbital foramen is rounded,
whereas in most species of the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> the foramen is
slitlike. In <em>Eutamias townsendii</em>, however, the infraorbital foramen
is rounded as much as in the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and in the genus
<em>Tamias</em>.</p>

<p><em>Width of the postorbital process at base.</em>&mdash;The postorbital process
is broader at the base in the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and in the genus
<em>Tamias</em> than in most species of the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em>. In <em>E.
townsendii</em>, however, this process is relatively as broad as in the
subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and in the genus <em>Tamias</em>.</p>

<p><em>Position of the supraorbital notch in relation to the posterior notch
of the zygomatic plate.</em>&mdash;In the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and in the genus
<em>Tamias</em> the supraorbital notch is distinctly anterior to the posterior
notch of the zygomatic plate, whereas in the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em>,
the supraorbital notch is only slightly anterior to the posterior notch
of the zygomatic plate. This difference may be correlated with
differences in size, since specimens of the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and
the genus <em>Tamias</em> are larger than specimens of the subgenus
<em>Neotamias</em>.</p>

<p><em>Degree of convergence of the upper tooth-rows.</em>&mdash;The rows of
upper cheek-teeth converge posteriorly in the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em>
and in the genus <em>Tamias</em>, except that in some specimens of <em>E.
sibiricus asiaticus</em> the rows of upper cheek-teeth are nearly parallel
to each other. In most species of the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> the rows
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>of upper cheek-teeth are nearly parallel to each other, although in
the specimens that I have seen of <em>E. townsendii</em>, the upper rows of
cheek-teeth converge posteriorly.</p>

<p><em>Degree of constriction of the interorbital region.</em>&mdash;The interorbital
region is more constricted in most species of the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em>
than in the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and the genus <em>Tamias</em>. In
specimens of <em>E. t. townsendii</em> of the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em>, however,
the degree of constriction of the interorbital region is approximately
the same as in the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and the genus <em>Tamias</em>.</p>

<p><em>Shape of the pinna.</em>&mdash;The pinna is narrower and more pointed in
the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> than in the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and the
genus <em>Tamias</em>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Structural Features that are too Weakly Expressed to be of
Taxonomic Use</span></h3>

<p>The following alleged characters have been mentioned in the
literature. Since the degree of expression of these features is so
slight, or since there is marked variation within one or more natural
groups of chipmunks, no reliance is here placed on these features.
They are as follows: (1) Degree of the posterior projection of the
palate; (2) relative size of the auditory bullae; (3) position, in
relation to P4, of the notch in the posterior edge of the zygomatic
plate; (4) size of m3 in relation to m2; (5) degree of development
of the mesoconid and ectolophid of the lower molars; (6) shape
and length of the rostrum; (7) degree of distinctness of minute
longitudinal grooves on the upper incisors.</p>

<p>A variation that does not readily fall in any one of the three categories
mentioned above is the degree of development of the lambdoidal
crest. The crest is least developed in the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em>
and most developed in the genus <em>Tamias</em>. The larger the
skull, the more the lambdoidal crest is developed; seemingly, therefore,
the degree of development is an expression of size of the skull
and may be determined by heterogonic growth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Discussion</span></h3>

<p>As shown in table <a href="#table1">1</a>, there are ten characters by means of which
<em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Tamias</em> can be separated consistently. The subgenus
<em>Eutamias</em> occurs on the Asiatic side and the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em>
occurs on the North American side of Bering Strait, yet the two
subgenera agree in the ten features referred to. Although the subgenus
<em>Neotamias</em> and the genus <em>Tamias</em> occur together in parts of
the United States and Canada, they differ in the ten features, indicating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>that the subgenera <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Neotamias</em> are more
closely related to each other than either is to <em>Tamias</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It must be pointed out here that the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> always
differs from both the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and the genus <em>Tamias</em> in
pointed <em>versus</em> rounded pinna of ear (see table <a href="#table2">2</a>) and in the
supraorbital notch being slightly posterior to or even with, instead of
distinctly anterior to, the posterior notch of the zygomatic plate.
The relative position of these two notches, however, seems to be a
matter of relative (heterogonic) growth. Further, the base of the
postorbital process of the frontal usually is narrower (relative to
the length of the process) in the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> but there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
a gradation in this feature in <em>Neotamias</em> culminating in the species
<em>E. townsendii</em> in which the bases of the processes are relatively as
broad as in the subgenus <em>Eutamias</em> and the genus <em>Tamias</em>. The
same condition obtains in the shape of the infraorbital foramen
which is subovate to rounded in the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em> and always
rounded in the other chipmunks.</p>

<p>These differences of <em>Neotamias</em> are so slight in comparison with

here is accorded only subgeneric rank under the genus <em>Eutamias</em>,
instead of generic rank.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Discussion</span></h3>

<p>Chipmunks are small striped squirrels that inhabit the Holarctic
Realm and that are found in similar niches in each of the three
regions: Palearctic, western Nearctic, and eastern Nearctic. Ellerman
(1940) and Bryant (1945) placed the chipmunks in three
subgenera, corresponding to the regions mentioned above, under
the one genus <em>Tamias</em>. Critical examination of new and old evidence
reveals, nevertheless, that the subgenera <em>Eutamias</em> and
<em>Neotamias</em> of the genus <em>Eutamias</em> are more closely related to one
another than either is to the genus <em>Tamias</em>. This relationship can
be seen clearly in the structure of the malleus, baculum, hyoid apparatus,
hyoid musculature, the presence or absence of P3, the
projection of the anterior root of P4 in relation to the masseteric
knob, and in the color pattern.</p>

<p>Because the genera <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Tamias</em> occupy similar ecological
niches, the structural similarities that permit these animals to
be called chipmunks, show convergence, and thus can be assumed
to be adaptive. These similarities are in the molars, in shape of the
skull, in color pattern and in other features which have been used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
by many systematists to interpret the phylogenetic relationships of
the squirrels. Pocock (1923:211), however, reviewed the taxonomic
literature on sciurids and wrote: &ldquo;The conclusion very forcibly
suggested by the literature of the subject is the untrustworthiness
of such characters.&rdquo; Pocock (<em>op. cit.</em>), correctly in my opinion,
then established a supraspecific classification of the sciurids based
almost exclusively on the structure of the baculum and glans penis.
I have studied the baculum in chipmunks and in all the major
supraspecific groups of Nearctic squirrels. The bacula of the
Nearctic squirrels and those of the Palearctic and Indian squirrels,
other than the chipmunks, are described and figured by Pocock (<em>op.
cit.</em>).</p>

<p>The baculum in <em>Eutamias</em>, in general plan of structure, resembles
the baculum in the genera <em>Callosciurus</em>, <em>Menetes</em>, <em>Rhinosciurus</em>,
<em>Lariscus</em>, <em>Dremomys</em>, and <em>Nannosciurus</em>, of the tribe Callosciurini
Simpson. The baculum in <em>Tamias</em>, in general plan of structure, resembles
that in <em>Spermophilus</em> (=<em>Citellus</em>) and <em>Cynomys</em> of the
tribe Marmotini Simpson. These tribes, designated by Simpson
(1945:79), are based on the corresponding subfamilies defined by
Pocock (1923:239-240) primarily on differences in the structure of
the baculum. I assign <em>Tamias</em> to the tribe Marmotini. I assign
<em>Eutamias</em> to the tribe Callosciurini, but do so only tentatively
because I have not, at first hand, studied the bacula of most of the
Callosciurini. The fossil record is too incomplete to reveal the time
when the two tribes diverged. The subgenera <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Neotamias</em>
are closely related. Indications are that the divergence of
the two subgenera occurred, geologically, but a short time ago,
possibly in Pleistocene time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusions</span></h3>

<p>1. <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Tamias</em> are distinct genera of chipmunks.</p>

<p>2. The subgenera <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Neotamias</em> are valid, for, <em>Eutamias
sibiricus</em> differs from all the species of the subgenus <em>Neotamias</em>
to a greater degree than these species differ from one another.</p>

<p>3. The genera <em>Eutamias</em> and <em>Tamias</em> probably evolved from two
distinct lines of sciurids; one line (<em>Eutamias</em>) is represented by the
tribe Callosciurini, and the other (<em>Tamias</em>) by the tribe Marmotini.</p>

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
